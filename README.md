# shiny application for bat detection

This is a simple shiny application for the [batdetect](https://github.com/macaodha/batdetect) project. With this application you can train a model with the data provided by [Bat Detective](http://visual.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pubs/batDetective/) and run this model on your own data.

To train after downloading the data from the link above, first you need to extract the "wav" folder and save it in the "data" folder.

To run the detection on your data, you need to upload your data to the "Rufe" folder.

After these two steps, run the app.py and enjoy the application.
